# Coaching Management System CRUD PHP MYSQL
Coaching Management System was submitted as a part of my assignment for an internship application during my Winter Break of 2019. 

It consists of multiple user types and their different actions. Technologies used were PHP/MYSQL and Bootstrap framework for Front-End.

Here was the problem statement -

a) You have to develop a project with three user types -

  i) Teacher.

  ii) Student.

  iii) Admin.

b) Admin can login and can CRUD (create, read, update and delete) students as well as teachers by adding their phone number, name, email address and password. Admin can then assign a teacher to multiple students (one to many relationships) by using multiple selections (checkbox).

c) Teachers can then login using password and email id that admin created for them. When the teacher logs in, he will see the students assigned to him (multiple students).

d) Students can also login to the account created by the admin for him and he will then see the teacher that has been assigned to him.

e) Add a field called subjects. Teachers can CRUD subjects as well and assign different subjects to the students assigned to him. So when the student logs in, he will be able to see the various subjects that the teacher will assign to him.
